Critical path vs Golden path




The first level takes place in a City Hall building. The player spawns in the lobby area, which features some armchairs and side tables made of wood and light fabric on both sides. There is also a reception in front of the player and an elevator behind the reception.
The player can also see the second level/mezzanine, and two side stairs to go up. Something catches the player's attention in the 2nd level/mezzanine floor, a bright panel, where the player can get quests/orders.

After talking with the receptionist, the player should go upstairs and get a quest/order. The quest/order starts in the 3rd floor room 33, the mayor's room, where the player should get a parcel, which is a letter, to deliver to the office 1(level 2)
