(Max 5 minutes):

1. The Problem & Vision
	- What was the initial problem you wanted to solve? 
		Create a dystopian Third Person Adventure game where Data is the new Oil

	- What did you want to make?
		- Non-linear game
		- Open hub with at least 7 hubs
		- Eye companion / inventory
		- Coin system
		- Collectables that changes player stamina stats
		- Guardbot enemy
		- Other buildings to decor the environment + to be acessed


	- Why did you want to make it?
		- I'm passionate about dystopian and when I started to do the capstone I was playing Tomb Raider 1-3 remastered, so we wanted to combine both worlds and have fun while doing a dystopian Sci-fi world.


	- What did you think you would make?
		- I tought we would make
			- a non-linear open hub with different areas where the player could access and grab differents quests/deliveries in their own pace and flow
			- Climbing mechanic
			- Create different buildings for each hub, some of them having Brazilian and Saudi Arabia references.
			- 


2.  Solution & Demo
	- What did you end up with?
		- We ended up with
			- a linear game
			- One level with 5 sections
			- Basic inventory
			- Basic climbing mechanic 


	- Show some footage or images
		***WIP***


3. Reflection
	- What changed along the way?
		We had to remove some aspects of the game, such as:
			- change from non-linear to linear
			- reduce level scope to only one
			- 

	- What were the biggest challenges? 
		BUGS everywhere
		Escope and Time management - Don't be afraid to change plans, embrace changes and abstractness.
		Improve knowledge on C++ and Unreal - Pomodore + Docs


	- What would you do differently?
		- Use Blender to do level blockout - Understand my Work Process and how I can deliver it faster

4. Future Plans
	- What do you plan to do with this project after?
		We plan to continue evolving this project and try to get fundings for it

	- How do you plan to use this as a jumping off point in your career?
		This whole project is going to be used as pieces for my Environment Art and Level Design portfolio
		With that, I want to work for a game studio and at the same time do some Freelancer jobs
